Grant cross-origin access to websites
You can enable CORS for websites that need cross-origin requests to the Okta API.

1. Select Security and then API.
2. Select the Trusted Origins tab.
3. Select Add Origin and then enter a name for the organization origin.
4. In the Origin URL box, specify the base URL of the website that you want to allow cross-origin requests from.
5. Make sure that CORS is selected as the Type. You can also enable the Redirect setting, which allows for redirection to this Trusted Origin after a user signs in or out.
6. Click Save.
